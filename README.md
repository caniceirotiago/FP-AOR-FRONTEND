## Technologies Used

React.js: Utilized as the main library for building the user interface. React's component-based architecture allows for the creation of reusable and high-performance components, ensuring a dynamic and responsive user experience.

React Router: Manages routing within the application, enabling efficient navigation between different pages without the need for full page reloads. This ensures smooth transitions for users.

CSS: Employed for detailed and aesthetic styling of interface elements, allowing for a customized look and feel of the application.

React Intl: Integrated for internationalization, supporting multiple languages and cultures to ensure global accessibility and an inclusive user experience.

WebSockets: Facilitates real-time communication between the frontend and backend, enabling instant updates and interactive features within the user interface.
